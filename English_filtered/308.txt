The impetus behind a revival of the ancient Silk Road connecting East and West in the 21st century was always more than just trade When President Xi Jinping proposed the initiative during a speech in Kazakhstan in 2013 he spoke also of the benefits of cooperation between people of different races beliefs and cultural backgrounds in pursuit of peaceful developmentIn a little more than half a decade the original idea has blossomed into the Belt and Road Initiative that links 125 countries and around 44 billion of the world's populationOn sites from Central Asia to Africa to the Greek port of Piraeus the spectacle of Chinese engineers and technicians working alongside their local counterparts has become commonplace The BRI has accelerated this process by providing jobs along the Belt and Road routes for tens of thousands of local people in Chinese financed and operated projectsChallenges in terms of peopletopeople tiesThe advent of the Belt and Road Initiative however has also created its own challenges in terms of peopletopeople relationships in the workplace and the boardroom With the strengthening of China's involvement in not only building but also operating major infrastructure projects Chinese executives and managers and their international counterparts have had to learn to adapt to each other's business culturesThe BRI marked a switch from the model in which Chinese companies built infrastructure projects linked say to transport and resources via bilateral arrangements that allowed them a degree of autonomy Now Chinese companies are increasingly required to work effectively beyond the building of infrastructure or a construction project and be experts at what we broadly call asset management－managing the continuing operations of a project that must generate adequate returns That includes finance procurement and personnelFrom building contractor to investor and operatorThe transition from construction contractor to investor and operator is new to Chinese companies so they have had to seek partnerships and develop new relationships with a wide range of multinational companies and financiersThis new requirement to work in tandem with local and global partners in previously unfamiliar settings has put Chinese personnel on a steep learning curve It has required a much deeper understanding of local political fiscal economic business and community dynamics It has required new skill sets to navigate thisThere is ample evidence however to suggest that China understands the challenges and recognizes the value of partnerships There is now a regular flow of Chinese delegations to the countries along the Belt and Road dispatched to study local regulations operating methods and the needs of their customersHowever nicely compiled study tour reports are no substitute for the practical experiences built up over decades by the international companies operating in those territories China's partners in the developed economies－European countries in particular－have deep expertise in achieving commercial and social successes in some of the developing countries along the Belt and RoadThere is now an unprecedented opportunity to build worldclass multicultural and multidisciplinary partnerships between China the developed economies and the BRI countries to create winwin solutions and ecosystems
