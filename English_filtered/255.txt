Editor's note The recent report that the University of Cambridge will accept gaokao scores for admission has sparked heated discussions online though later the university said the policy was adopted several years ago Actually a growing number of foreign universities are accepting China's gaokao results as one of their admission criteria Is Chinese entrance exam being recognised globally Forum readers share their opinionsceciliazhang ChinaThe gaokao is a really tough exam and if possible can be used as one of the indicators for foreign universities but not to the exclusion of other indicators such as language proficiency The very best performers on the gaokao are intelligent knowledgeable and they are able to adapt successfully to the radically different teaching and learning styles of Western education I believe it is a winwin for Chinese students and overseas universities
