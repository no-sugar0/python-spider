Speech by HE Ambassador Liu Xiaoming at the HSBC Chinese New Year Celebration2019 Pool Our Wisdom to Create ProsperityFour Seasons Hotel London 12 February 2019Chairman Mark TuckerMinistersMy LordsLadies and GentlemenDear FriendsGood afternoonI have attended HSBC Chinese New Year Celebration eight times in as many years Today it is a real pleasure to be back for the ninth timeThe year 2019 is the Year of the Pig Recently I attended quite a few Chinese New Year celebrations hosted by British friends from all walks of life I find that they have different interpretations of the Year of the Pig Some people think pig symbolises laziness and sloppiness Some like the Year of the Boar because they prefer the ferocity and strength of the boarThe fact is in China pig is traditionally regarded as the most important of the six domesticated animals The Year of the Pig foretells good weather and bumper harvestNow what will the Year of the Pig bring to China and ChinaUK relationsThe Chinese economy is drawing global attention lately Some people talk it up Some others talk it down There are worries about the negative impact of ChinaUS trade war There are concerns about the slowest growth rate in 28 years There are even claims that the reform and opening up have stopped or even backpaddledSo what is the real situation with the Chinese economy I think the answer can be found in the name of your group HSBCH stands for healthyIn 2018 China continued to be the world's second largest economy with its GDP setting a new record of 136 trillionMore importantly this is achieved on the basis of optimized economic structure shifting growth model and greener developmentInvestment slowed down in infrastructure but accelerated in manufacturing and the private sector The greatest increase was in hightech industriesOutdated production capacity was being replaced New products new industries and new business models kept emergingGrowth became greener Energy consumption per unit GDP decreased by 31% the share of clean energy in total energy consumption increased by 13%As a result the Chinese economy is healthier as it shifts from highspeed growth to highquality growthThe second letter S stands for strongIn 2018 the Chinese economy grew by 66% This is slightly slower than previous years but given the size of the Chinese economy 14 trillion and more than 30 years of highspeed growth this rate is nonetheless significantWhen it comes to China's economic growth we should look at increment as well as speed The GDP increment of last year was around 14 trillion which was roughly the total GDP of Australia It is also much higher than China's own GDP increment of over 600 billion in 2007 when the growth rate was a staggering 142%Over the years China has been a major powerhouse for world economic growth We have contributed an average of over 30% to world economic growth A recent British media report says that among the three major engines of the world economy namely China the US and the EU China remains to be the largest one with a robust growth momentum I couldn't agree more with thisThe third letter B stands for bonusWith sustained development the Chinese economy continues to be a bonus to the worldBy importing from the world China will help balance the world economy stabilise commodity prices and support recovery in raw material exportersThe Chinese market has been a key force driving global consumption In recent years the average annual contribution of China's final consumption expenditure to global consumption growth was 234% higher than that of the US Japan and the EU China has also been the world's largest source of outbound tourists for many years in a rowLast November the first China International Import Expo was held in Shanghai More than 3600 companies and over 400000 purchasers from 172 countries regional economies and international organisations took part in the Expo A total of 5783 billion worth of deals were signed including Â£2 billion deals signed with UK companiesLater this year the second International Import Expo will take place I look forward to a strong representation from Britain at the eventThe last letter C stands for cooperativeThe key word of China's economic policies in 2018 is openness This is a solemn pledge made by President Xi Jinping who said China will not close its door instead China will open its door even wider to the worldIn line with this pledge China announced a number of important measures of further opening up last year includingdeepening marketoriented reformprotecting property rights and IPRencouraging fair competitionand expanding importThe opening up of the financial sector is also picking up speed New openingup measures cover foreign banks insurance securities and trust They will improve the business environment for foreign investment provide more effective legal guarantee and boost the confidence of foreign businessesAs a result 2018 saw China's import and export totaling 3051 trillion RMB yuan and paidin investment reaching 88561 billion RMB yuan Both set new recordsCapital votes with their feet In 2018 the international community cast a vote of confidence in the economic prospects of ChinaI hope the HSBC I just outline will bolster your confidence in Chinese economy And I know for sure that the HSBC Group has been spreading confidence in China through its concrete actionsHSBC is the only financial institution in the world whose name reflects two Chinese citiesIt was one of the first British companies to enter Chinese marketIt is one of foreign companies that enjoys the closest links with ChinaIt has set up more than 170 banking outlets in over 50 cities on Chinese mainland topping all other foreign banksIt had been awarded Best Foreign Bank in China by FinanceAsia for 16 times in the past 18 yearsPlease allow me to take this opportunity to pay tributes and offer my congratulations to HSBC for your achievementsLet me quote a famous line from an ancient Chinese poem to conclude my remarksA time will come to ride the wind and cleave the wavesI'll set my cloudwhite sail and cross the sea which ravesI believe that the Year of the Pig will be an auspicious year for China a promising year for ChinaUK relations and a prosperous year for HSBCThe Chinese name for HSBC is Hui Feng meaning respectively pool and prosperI hope we can pool the wisdom of both China and the UK to make our people prosper and to make new and greater contribution to the ChinaUK Golden EraIn conclusion I wish you a happy and successful Year of the PigThank
