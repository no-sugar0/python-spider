Request to take offApprovedAnd with that three J10 fighter jets take off instantlyThis was my first chance to see the Chinese August 1st or Bayi aerobatics team and as first impressions go the huge sound wave produced by the new domestic developed J10 fighter jet is a spectacular oneIt is hard not to be impressed by the team and their impressive role of honor but I was more interested in getting to know the individual team members rather than the badge and to hear their stories and dreamsThe first person in the team I got to know was Jing Fei chief of No1 brigade You speak very good English I told him as it is noticeable how they use Aviation English in daily training which is not common in the Chinese air forceI have read professional aviation English for many years he laughed Now the Bayi aerobatics team's daily training is bilingual but aviation English remains important to us since we have had many international performances since 2013Can we do this interview in English then I joked with him But one detail I noticed in their dormitory was interesting and shows how they practice aviation English On the right side of the dormitory door there is a small white board where every day the pilots write an aviation English sentence so that as they go in and out of the room they are always being reminded of the languageChina's Bayi aerobatics team is now a wellregarded part of the international aerobatics industry In 2013 they made their first appearance in Russia at the Moscow Air Show and two years later they went to the Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition in MalaysiaIn 2017 they performed at the Dubai Air Show before another appearance in Russia one year later and their most recent international engagement was in Islamabad for Pakistan's national day paradeEveryone in the team was excited to share memories of when they perform abroad and to talk about the maneuvers they perform but to be honest I was not the greatest audience for this What did strike me however was when the captain of the Bayi team said how on their visit to Pakistan he noticed the state of readiness of the Pakistan Air Force and the atmosphere of combat He said it made him realize he was lucky to be born in China a peaceful country where even military personnel are not close to real warThis year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China Where has our happiness come from in recent years We may complain about the inequality of healthcare resources We may complain about our salary We may complain about air quality – but we have time to complain about these things because we live in a peaceful land We don't need to worry about wars We have a peaceful environment to work hard and chase our dreamsActually I do have one question why do we need an aerobatics team in the Chinese Air Force at all The answer comes out on my second night at the base At eight o'clock pilots are preparing for a night flight Obviously aerobatics performance flights never take place at night but they are practicing to maintain their skill as a combat force When preparing for their performance flights the pilots are easygoing and lighthearted but for night flights the atmosphere changed a lot Everybody knows how serious combat flight is Now they are ready to fight against the enemy and safeguard of our skyThe Bayi aerobatics team is definitely showing people the combat capabilities of Chinese Air force They are not only performers – they are also Chinese soldiers safeguarding peace for all the people in the world
