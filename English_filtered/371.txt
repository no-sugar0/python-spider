The National Bureau of Statistics reported last week that China's topline GDP growth rate in the first quarter was 64 percent at the upper end of the government's target of 6 to 65 percent growth for 2019 This fasterthanexpected growth gives policymakers some breathing room to continue a stable monetary policy and to implement fiscal policies aimed both at transforming the economy and at reducing the risks of accumulated debtChinese policymakers are dealing with the hard dilemma of simultaneously transforming the longterm nature of the economy while avoiding shortterm inflation or recession To transform the economy the nation needs to continue to reduce outstanding debt levels and shift from overcapacity heavy and extractive industries to a more innovative consumerfocused economy The danger is that moving too fast in that direction could throw lots of people out of work or cause the financial collapse of companiesThis quarter's data show that China is avoiding this shortterm dangers while still moving toward longterm goalsThe consumer inflation rate was 18 percent yearonyear and producer prices went up only 02 percent A standard rule of thumb used by central bankers worldwide is that the inflation rate should be targeted at about 2 percent per year This rule is actually built in to the mandate of the European Central Bank So the stable monetary policy of the People's Bank of China the nation's central bank is workingThe March unemployment rate in urban areas was 52 percent slightly below the level last year Most economists define full employment as anything below 6 percent so we are not seeing significant problematic unemployment even during a period of major economic transformationOther commonly used disaggregated growth measures are consistent with the topline measured GDP growth number For example production and supply of electricity thermal power gas and water increased by 71 percent in the quarter Plus valueadded index of transport storage and post increased by 73 percentA closer look at the highest growth sectors shows that the economy is moving toward the longterm goal of shifting away from a development strategy based on heavy investment in industry and infrastructure to one based on services and domestic consumption Also more productive industries that turn out highervalue added goods are growing at a much faster rate than traditional heavy industryAmong large companies Stateowned enterprises grew 45 percent yearonyear while shareholding enterprises grew almost twice as fast at 78 percent So strong progress is being made toward the goal of promoting private enterprise which was reinforced by many policies announced at last month's meeting of the National People's CongressServices are growing rapidly The valueadded of the tertiary sector which is mainly services grew from 567 to 573 percent of GDP from the same period last year The Index of Services Production increased 74 percent yearonyear higher than the growth rate of overall GDPOverall retail sales of consumer goods also grew at 83 percent Sales of upgraded consumer goods witnessed fast growth with the highest rates concentrated in upgraded products such as cosmetics phones and computersAnd hightech services grew at an astonishing rate of 212 percent In preparing for consumer 5G telecoms next year the output of mobile communications base stations grew 1537 percentThe data also show strong movement toward the government's goal of creating an ecological civilization New energy automobiles and solar cells grew by 482 percent and 182 percent respectively Sales of urban rail vehicles grew by 541 percent showing the continued investment in environmentfriendly urban mass transit According to NBS preliminary estimates the share of consumption of clean energy such as natural gas hydropower nuclear power and wind power in total energy consumption in the first quarter was 15 percentage points higher than that of the same period last year Energy consumption per unit of GDP went down by 27 percent yearonyearTotal investment in fixed assets grew by 63 percent with private investment growing at 64 percent slightly faster than the overall number This is especially significant in the light of last year's fears that private investment in the economy might collapse So the government's efforts to strengthen the private sector appear to have borne fruitInvestment in hightech manufacturing rose by 114 percent and investment in hightech services rose 193 percent both far higher than overall investment growth This shows that the shift toward advanced manufacturing and services is well underwayAnd despite ongoing tensions the total value of imports and exports rebounded sharply in March reaching 96 percent higher than March 2018 So overall trade grew by 37 percent yearonyear in the quarter despite low growth rates in January and February Exports of electrical and mechanical products which are higher value added grew by 54 percent in the quarter And private sector trade grew 99 percent far more than the overall growth rateI am worried to see that total investment in real estate grew by 118 percent yearonyear Having lived through the 2008 financial crisis in the United States I'm wary of continued high investment in real estate in a time when property prices are already astonishingly high and China's living space per person has already surpassed that in EuropeThe bottom line is that fiscal and monetary policies combined with policies to promote structural transformation have achieved a stable macroeconomic situation and steady movement toward supply side upgrading
