Wikileaks founder Julian Assange will fight his possible extradition to the United States in a British court The US Department of Justice has accused Assange of helping former intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to break into a Pentagon computer system and the US administration has filed an official request with Britain for Assange's extraditionA British court has already sentenced Assange to 50 weeks in prison for jumping bail following his arrest by London police from the Ecuadorian embassy on April 11 after the Ecuadorian government withdrew the political asylum granted to him in 2012Many consider the Wikileaks founder a hero for defying Washington and releasing thousands of confidential US documents related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq which severely damaged the US' imageThe US administration has accused Assange of invading its cyberspace mainly due to the Vault 7 leaks that revealed the details of the CIA's works No wonder many see the US Justice Department's attempts to arrest Assange as a crackdown on whistleblowersThe US Justice Department's decision is based on three factors First it wants to preempt any further damage to the US' image For example in April 2017 Mike Pompeo then CIA director said Wikileaks' actions are comparable to those by a hostile intelligence agency and Assange and his likes are trying to destroy Western values to boost their personal standing in societySecond the US wants to expand its influence in Latin America So Pompeo who is now US secretary of state required Ecuador to withdraw the political asylum it had given to Assange in 2012 to get US economic and financial support in exchangeThird the US administration wants to remove the potential obstacles for the 2020 presidential election With the investigations into Russia's possible involvement in the 2016 US presidential election being dropped the US administration has chosen to plug the other loopholes by taking action against Assange which in turn would not only blunt the Democrats' attack on the Republicans but also prevent any more leaks of US documentsJeremy Corbyn British Labor Party leader has condemned the US' extradition request and said the US is eager to have Assange extradited because he exposed thousands of documents related to the US military's war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan And former Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa said incumbent Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno aims to please the US and get loans from the International Monetary Fund in exchange for withdrawing the political asylum to AssangeThat the US has sought the extradition of Assange because he revealed many of the brutalities and criminal acts of the US military shows freedom of the internet exists only on paper in the US No wonder Correa said the arrest of Assange reflects the double standard practiced by Western countriesCompared with Edward Snowden a whistleblower and former US National Security Agency agent who was granted asylum by Russia the experience of Assange is tragic and shows that those who expose the ugly side of Western governments cannot get political asylum in any Western countryWikileaks' expos√© highlights the hypocrisy of the West when it comes to internet freedom In particular since the US controls 11 of the 13 root servers in the world and the other two servers are situated in its ally countries there is a big question mark on internet freedom Even if internet freedom exists it is under surveillance of the USThe US is known to force other countries to open their internet networks in exchange for deepening or improving trade relations And with the ChinaUS trade negotiation reaching a critical point it would be interesting to see whether the US uses the same ploy against China and asks it to open its cyberspaceThe author is a researcher at the National Academy of Development and Strategy and a professor at the School of International Studies Renmin University of China The views don't necessarily represent those of China Daily
