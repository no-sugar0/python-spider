Government should follow example of business says former senior advisorFormer senior British diplomatic advisor Charles Powell says the country needs to think of China as a partner not an enemy when accommodating its rising power and new prominence on the international stage and that the government should follow the lead of business with a proactive policy towards Asia as a wholeIn an informative and wideranging speech at St Mary's University in London entitled The New Leviathan Managing China's Rise Powell a former private secretary to prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major spoke of the challenges and opportunities presented by China's transformation over the last four decades and how Britain should respond to them for the good of all involvedThe favorite tagline of our politicians at the moment is 'Global Britain' but to date it is a completely vapid concept with noone attempting to define it but relations with China and Asia will be the most obvious place to give it substance and meaning especially in a postBrexit world he saidWe need our government to get on with defining its strategy towards China  British companies have given the lead in designating Asia as the future for business government has been slower and inconsistent in defining a roleThe rise of China Powell went on is more likely than anything else in the foreign policy universe to disrupt the status quo and to impact the lives and fortunes of those at university today That makes it very important to understand China's past how it looks at the world and how it sees its own destinyAs a career civil servant and diplomat who spent years at the heart of government and who was also president of the China Britain Business Council and vicechairman of the advisory board to the Fudan University Business School Powell has developed a great understanding of China in contrast to his school days when he said China didn't feature much if at all in the history books 60 years ago  it featured scandalously little a black hole in our educationSpeaking in front an audience which included Wang Yongli minister counsellor for education at China's embassy in the UK Powell repeated Napoleon Bonaparte's famous quote about the country－China is a sleeping giant let her sleep because when she wakes she will move the world－while discussing the country's traumatic past how that shaped its resurgent present and would direct its futureIf ever a country has been through the wringer it is China he said It's the key to understanding modern China born in humiliation division and defeat both because of selfexclusion from the world and through foreign subjugation and exploitationWhat drives it now is a determination to expunge the shame of the past and as Chairman Mao put it to see China stand up again I doubt any nation has ever been driven by any emotion as strong as this It embraces nationalism but it's more than nationalism it's vindication and a desire for respectPowell's speech was by no means uncritical of all China policies He said he was not a panda hugger and spoke of the environmental economic and other challenges the country faced while also supporting the US approach to engage more with China in fair trade business and competition saying that its Chinese companies will be exposed to a much greater degree of competition until it figures out how to be both competitive and play by the rulesBut overall he concluded he felt upbeat about the role a resurgent China could play in world affairs and said lessons must be learnt from the old Cold War between the West and Communist bloc in Eastern Europe to ensure such mistakes were not repeated when dealing with the new superpowerI am fundamentally positive about China's prospects he said The Cold War in its time diverted resources on a massive scale and led us into enormous risks There has to be a better way to resolve conflicts this time with the world's new rising power
