For two years 39yearold Gen Congguo has been dedicated to the planting of gourds  an essential material in making a cucurbit flute  in Yunnan province's Lianghe county his hometown where the flute is believed to have originatedThe soil here grows the best gourds Besides it's my uncle's will to revitalize the instrument at its birthplace said Gen who returned to Banggai village in 2014 six years after his uncle flute master Gen Dequan died in Kunming where the two ran a studio and made cucurbit flutes which are popular ethnic musical instruments in ChinaGen is the only inheritor of the craft of master Gen Dequan The senior Gen not only excelled in making and playing the flutes but also composed many catchy household tunes featuring the instrumentThree years after the younger Gen returned to Banggai in 2017 he realized that the flute also known as the hulusi was of little value in its cradle in Lianghe a nationallevel povertystricken county where the average disposable annual income per capita is no more than 3200 yuan 476The flute tradition did not seem to help despite its popularity in bigger cities like Kunming Beijing and Shanghai and being selected by some primary schools as an instrument to be masteredLianghe is populated with a variety of ethnic groups including Dai Lisu and Achang It is a narrow strip of land tucked between the betterknown Tengchong and Yingjiang counties The underdeveloped infrastructure and mountain lifestyle embraced by local ethnic groups for centuries and its few commercial exchanges or even communication with the outside world have been major impediments to economic growthToday growing and processing tobacco remains one of the pillar industries for the farmdominated county However Gen is confident that the flutes which he sells for 360 yuan to 1980 yuan each with every part handmade can be as helpful as tobacco for lifting his fellow villagers out of poverty That is why he has dedicated himself to planting gourdsNot only has Gen doubled the productivity of the gourds to 60000 per hectare but he has also found ways to use gourds that are unsuitable for making flutes  those with bug bites or poor shapes for example He makes them into tea filters or lamp covers It is estimated that more than onethird of gourds grown naturally cannot be used to make the wind chest for the fluteGen estimated that farmers can profit between 100000 and 120000 yuan per hectare by growing gourds after taking all sales of gourd products into accountEvery year he sells about 1000 cucurbit flutes under the brand founded by his uncle which he said was only onethird of the orders to his studioThe county government has also been trying to entice more flute makers to the region to create a more diverse industry including tourism and training in flute playing The former residence of Gen's family has been renovated into a sightseeing spot open to publicThere are several million cucurbit flute players across China both professional and amateur because the instruments are easy to carry and learn though they are difficult to perfectGen can finish some tunes without changing his breath and the sound from his flute is pure smooth and mellow like a clarinet
