TOKYO Â Japan Airlines JAL officials said Wednesday they have overcome a glitch in their passenger checkin system for domestic flights although 32 domestic flights were canceled and 2500 passengers were adversely affectedAccording to the airline a system failure that began at around 650 am local time meant that throngs of passengers had to battle queues and try to check in manually at airportsThe furor among passengers was due to a glitch apparently knocking out airports' automated systems including the use of QRcodes to check in for reserved flights and automatic checkin machines at airports such as Haneda in TokyoThe system problem caused delays of up to two and a half hours for some domestic JAL flights and around 2500 passengers were affected by the system errorJAL officials said the problem was rectified by around 1000 am local time and believed a network error was to blame possibly stemming from one of two servers not operating properlyThe officials said that after ascertaining that one of its two servers related to automated checkins had potentially malfunctioned they disconnected the problematic server which helped restore operations to normalThe company is still looking into the cause of the glitch and the potentially faulty server and said that as a result of the system failure 32 flights to and from Tokyo Osaka Fukuoka and Sendai have been canceledLocal media quoted some irate passengers as saying that JAL failed to communicate with them effectively about the problem and relay information efficiently about the lengthy delaysOthers said they were completely left in the dark by JAL with no information provided at all as to the cause and length of the delays as they were left queuing at oversubscribed counters to check in for flights that they later found had been canceled
