Firm ramps up efforts to promote nuclear tech for industrial and commercial useThe China Institute of Atomic Energy CIAE one of the 23 science and research arms of China National Nuclear Corporation has been ramping up efforts to utilize nuclear technologies for industrial and commercial useSet up in 1950 CIAE is widely considered the cradle of nuclear science and technology in the nation as it pioneered the development and successful construction of China's first nuclear reactor and cyclotron in the 1950sNow CIAE has become a fundamental nuclear research base in China with comprehensive capabilities in nuclear energy nuclear science and technology and nuclearrelated services with more than 3000 employeesOur largescale science platforms provide researchers with unique and excellent conditions for fundamental and innovative research and development in nuclear science and related areas said Wan Gang Party chief of CIAEOur hightech products based on nuclear technologies are increasingly being used in civilian markets he said adding that the institute is currently developing a 230 million electron volt superconducting cyclotronThe superconducting cyclotron a key component for mainstream proton therapy systems is likely to become fully commissioned next year for clinical trials making it the first of its kind in China according to Zhang Tianjue director of the Cyclotron Research and Design Center of CIAEProton therapy or proton radiotherapy is a type of therapy that uses a particle accelerator to irradiate diseased tissue with a beam of protons most often as treatment for cancerCompared with conventional radiotherapy proton beams will only release a large percentage of radiation dose when they reach a tumor which means it will kill the cancer cells while leaving healthy cells intact according to ZhangCancer is among the top diseases in China and it is important for us to help cancer patients with domestically developed devices We have not only the willingness but also the technology and capabilities as the cyclotrons that CIAE makes are among the best in the worldAbout 73 percent of installed proton therapy systems in the world use cyclotrons to produce proton beams according to Lyu Yinlong deputy director of the centerWith proton therapy systems being used for domestically made accelerators treatment costs for Chinese cancer patients will be largely reduced said Zhang and Lyu If patients opt for proton therapy with imported systems or abroad the costs could more than double they saidApart from the medical sector the institute has also designed a new type of safe economical and environmentally friendly nuclear heating reactor for district heating with its independently developed pooltype lowtemperature reactor YanlongDuring a demonstration last winter the reactor was used to supply heat to three buildings of about 10000 square meters in CIAE continuously for 30 daysThe demonstration has proved the feasibility of the pooltype lowtemperature heating reactor and marked important progress for followup commercial use of such nuclear heating technology said Liu Xingmin director of the reactor core design section at the instituteChina has built a number of pooltype reactors which have cumulatively operated for 500 reactor years proving such reactors are stable and reliable according to Liu A reactor year is one year of operations for a reactorPooltype lowtemperature reactors run under normal pressure and at low temperatures with water acting as a neutron moderator coolant and radiation shield Liu saidThe layer of water shields the radiation so completely that as long as there is water above the reactor core the reactor will be safe and stable even if affected by earthquakes of magnitude between 7 and 8 he addedMoreover the nuclear heating system is cost efficient and a 400megawatt Yanlong lowtemperature heating reactor could heat up to 20 million square meters equivalent to 200000 homes according to LiuIts average price is far superior to gas although it is not as cheap as coalfired power or heat cogeneration units Liu saidBesides it can be constructed near the sea or on land making it a good fit for China's northern areas as the nation attaches great importance to environmental protection and is seeking clean energy to replace coalfired heating that aggravates air pollution in North China Liu saidHe said that a couple of cities in North China have contacted the CIAE for Yanlong reactorbased nuclear heating programs and researchers at the institute are seeking to further reduce the cost of the nuclear heating systemWan the Party chief of the CIAE said the institute's other products based on nuclear technologies including medical isotopes used in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and devices for industrial irradiation a very effective way to sterilize goods are also very popular among both domestic and foreign users
