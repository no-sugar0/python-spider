The spectacular sacking of the UK defense minister over a leak from a topsecret security meeting has highlighted a debate over Chinese company Huawei's role in the UK's telecom networksGavin Williamson the minister in question continues to maintain his innocence in a saga that reveals more about a breakdown of discipline within Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexitbeleaguered government than it does about Britain's state secretsThe leak to the Daily Telegraph newspaper from the National Security Council NSC an adhoc grouping of ministers and spy chiefs revealed that a number of May's close associates  Williamson included  had raised concerns about a decision to allow Huawei to help build the UK's 5G networkAlthough the leak was initially viewed as a potential criminal breach of the Official Secrets Act the police have since decided it was not  you do not have to be James Bond to find out what the secret meeting was discussingA clue to that is in a report from something called the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation CentreHCSEC Oversight Board which is freely available on the official UK government websiteThe evaluation center is based at a business park in Oxfordshire and owned by Huawei where company employees work under the oversight of the UK's GCHQ spy agency on cybersecurity issuesThe socalled cell was set up in 2010 to address UK concerns about the robustness of Huawei's security protocols at a time when the company had already established partnerships with UK telecoms companiesThis intense level of cooperation between the Chinese company and British officials may come as a surprise to most people in Britain to whom Huawei was hardly a household name before the leak controversy erupted at the end of AprilThe latest 46page findings from the cell's Oversight Board amount to a must try harder report on the company's operations HCSEC's work continues to identify significant concerning issues in Huawei's approach to software development bringing significantly increased risk to UK operators the report concludedThe report revealed that UK intelligence was concerned that security weaknesses could be exploited by a range of outside actors although it stressed that cybersecurity officials did not believe that the defects identified are a result of Chinese state interferenceHuawei responded by acknowledging the concerns about its software engineering capabilities We understand these concerns and take them very seriously said a company spokespersonThe debate on Huawei and cybersecurity is not of course confined to the UK The United States has blocked Huawei and urged its allies to do likewise Some countries including Australia have followed suit but the UK is clearly among those countries that want to maintain a relationship with the Chinese company as it moves into the 5G eraIn the UK however the Huawei debate has erupted at a time of almost unprecedented political turmoil as a lameduck prime minister finds herself under fire from all sides for her failure to get her deal on the country's departure from the European Union through ParliamentAs rivals within her own Conservative Party vie to replace her when she eventually quits  commentators say her premiership may have only weeks or months to run  the Huawei issue has emerged as yet one more stick with which to beat herSome potential successors are casting themselves as security hawks in comparison with May and her finance minister chancellor Philip Hammond who are portrayed as soft on ChinaWilliamson was among those who had placed himself firmly on the side of the hawks when he said in December that he had very deep concerns about Huawei's involvement in the UK's 5G networkThe subtext of the antiHuawei camp is that May and her Cabinet allies are putting commercial benefit above the national interestIn more normal times such disagreements would have been confined to the closed environment of the NSC But that was blown apart by the April leakDespite the secrecy that would normally surround such highlevel deliberations the actual pros and cons of the Huawei debate are freely availableIan Levy the technical director of GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre also known as NCSC outlined the issues at stake in a February blog post that is still freely available on the NCSC's websiteThe details are very important and security implications of certain decisions will be different across different countries and even different networks in the same country he wrote in a more sober tone than that which has characterized the political controversyLevy has not been uncritical of Huawei's alleged lapses In an April interview he referred to alleged shoddy engineering practices and said the company could be barred from working on the inner core of the 5G networkThat seems to be precisely the conclusion reached at the notorious leaked meeting The government essentially decided to maintain the status quo by limiting Huawei's products to the outer ring of the network perhaps raising the question of what all the fuss was aboutHarvey Morris is a senior media consultant for China Daily UK
