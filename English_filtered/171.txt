Generations of Chinese people growing up between the 1980s and the early 2000s will no doubt share fond collective memories of spending the long afternoons of their childhood summer vacations squeezed in front of small TV sets watching their favorite showsMost people will be able to reel off the names of these productions which have been broadcast over and over again the historical detective drama The Arbiter the martial arts saga Legend of the Dragonslayer Sword the fantasy New Legend of Madame White Snake You name it we've all seen themNevertheless for the content managers at Youku one of China's leading video streaming platforms one problem has been bothering them for a long timeWhen they finally gained the broadcasting rights for these old drama series  in a bid to tap into people's nostalgia  they were embarrassed to find users soon abandoning the series Some viewers even stopped watching after less than a minute their big data analysis showedThese old TV series are such classics that the storylines and the acting were not the problem says Pei Yinxiang an IT engineer from Youku There was something wrong with the quality of the imagesWhile vintage roles and stories may be able to survive the test of time the pictures cannot When the blurred images and dark colors flicker onto the screens of modern digital devices which are set up for highdefinition viewing the viewers' lukewarm response was easy to predictThe original tapes were often scratched or tarnished by mildew after being stored for such a long time Pei explains You can imagine what they will look like on online streaming mediaConsequently Youku launched a project to digitally restore these old drama series in NovemberWhile the restoration of old films is commonplace in the movie industry this kind of work on TV series is rare in China largely because of the length of time it takesRestoring a featurelength film by hand can easily take months if not up to half a year Hong Kong film director Peter Hosun Chan once said the image restoration of his most acclaimed work Comrades Almost a Love Story cost 15 million yuan 224000 excluding the expenses for restoring the soundtrackFaced with hundreds old TV series to restore Youku was naturally reluctant to throw such a huge sum of money at every project Their technicians then turned to artificial intelligence to develop programs that could automatically enhance the tapesIf a lengthy manual framebyframe restoration might be able to achieve a full score of 10 at least we could turn an 'unwatchable' series into one that achieves a score of 7 to 8 points within a shorter period of time using mass digital techniques says Jiang Wenfei a leading technician and head of Youku's 30member restoration teamHe estimates that a single episode takes one working day to restore using traditional methodsPei explains that correcting the color cast is the most common problem they have to fix People's faces sometimes look like they are covered by dirt on film and their black hair turns green or blueAI algorithms also give the images a much higher definitionNevertheless while the team once thought that AI offered all the solutions a new question soon arose Audience members asked Where's the original flavorAfter restoring the images to their original state they soon began to realize that people still needed some nostalgia For example old series made by Hong Kongbased company TVB usually have yellowing images but many viewers complained that its retro ambience had vanished after the color cast was corrected Jiang saysPeople then said our restored version looked like a camera filter has been added Pei says with a bitter smile We then had to go back and adapt our methodsMore complicated algorithms were later developed to carry out a tailored plan for each type of series including those by TVB Chinese mainland productions from the 1980s and Taiwan productions of the 1990s Some techniques in handson restorations were introduced later too as Pei confesses even the best AI cannot handle every casePeople's tastes are more highly developed Jiang says We just want to give people the same feeling watching them on digital devices today as they had on small TV screens years agoMore than 300 TV series have been restored since November and Pei says all their data has gradually helped to build up a database which will further improve the algorithmsIn March the restored edition of 2003's Legend of the Dragonslayer Sword was released online through Youku Unexpectedly it soon climbed into the top 10 list of mostviewed drama series on the platform with all the others being new productionsJiang points out that many adaptations of old classics are now being made following the rise of online streaming media platformsBut they are often heavily criticized he says I don't know whether it is because the performances are so poor However if we can make the original productions look just like new ones through restoration people can at least have more choiceThe 1980s classic The Bund produced by TVB a story set in Shanghai in the 1930s starring Chow Yunfat has so far been the most timeconsuming restoration work but Jiang says it's worth itGeorge Lucas spent many years restoring old Star Wars films he made himself Jiang says It's almost like a remake We're also looking to create a classic Chinese production which needs just as much of our energySpeaking of the future Pei says there is no end to their work People get used to watching TV productions shot in 4K resolution today However once 8K becomes common viewers might consider 4K shows 'unwatchable' again Today's work will still need restoration one day
