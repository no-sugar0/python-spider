was acquired by Nestl√© Group in 2011 chose this event to kick off its marketing campaign for the Chinese Lunar New Year which begins on TuesdayWith television serials about the Qing Dynasty period such as The Story of Yanxi Palace and Ruyi's Royal Love in the Palace proving popular among the younger generation last year Hsu Fu Chi has developed a series of royaltyand palacethemed entertainment content and gift packsThe move is to better communicate with younger consumers by emphasizing popular traditional elements given that the atmosphere of Spring Festival or Nian year festivities has grown somewhat weaker each year said Qiao Ruilin marketing manager of Hsu Fu ChiFor this year's weeklong holiday Hsu Fu Chi has rolled out 43 varieties of candy cakes and chocolates In addition to renovating displays at its offline stores it has introduced its new products on its online storesThe palacethemed packaging is not just to be in line with a recent trend but more importantly an attempt to pass on China's significant cultural heritage to the younger generation during the Spring Festival holiday said QiaoMeanwhile Beijingbased teamaker Xiao Guan Tea has partnered with the Prince Kung's Palace Museum to introduce Spring Festival gift packs of tea as part of the company's efforts to attract younger Chinese back to tea consumptionThe tea gift packs themed Good Fortune are

Tea's retail sales reached 2 billion yuan 295 million making it the No 1 tea brand in the countryZhu Danpeng an independent fast moving consumer goods analyst said the challenge of selling historythemed products to younger consumers requires new techniques of marketingTraditionrelated merchandise these days is seen as intellectual property as it can get younger consumers' attention and unlock their purchasing powerThe IP rights of the Palace Museum and the Prince Kung's Palace Museum are part of the rare and renowned resources that have an overwhelming fan base nationwide Zhu saidTherefore it would benefit the brands to be associated with such popular IP he saidIn addition to working with the Palace Museum on ancient royalty themes the biggest intellectual property of the year is the adorable pig image as the 12month lunar period beginning Feb 5 is regarded the Year of the Pig It has become the mostsoughtafter IP for numerous marketing campaigns of retail brandsFor instance the Disney store launched its Chinese New Yearthemed products specially designed for the Chinese market A large portfolio of products with various characters of pig in Disney's animations was launched by working with licensee partners The brand crossovers included Lao Feng Xiang's gold accessories and Chow Tai Fook jewelryAllen Au Yeung vicepresident of creative and product development in the AsiaPacific region for The Walt Disney Company said Disney's lovable characters such as Piglet Pumba Hamm Ms Piggy and the Three Little Pigs have been part of many childhood memories across generationsWith Chinese New Year upon us a celebratory occasion that brings families together we are thrilled to bring fans a fun collection of products adorned with these playful characters to usher

the elements of traditional Chinese cultureIt is the first time for Lu to be wrapped in red and round shaped package to go with the Chinese New Year atmosphereHowever analyst Zhu said despite the frenzy in promoting brands with Chinese traditional elements and other kinds of IP like cultural heritage elements the challenge for such marketing of brands is to maintain the product's top quality
