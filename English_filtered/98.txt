WASHINGTON  An asteroid named 99942 Apophis will fly towards the Earth in ten years the US space agency NASA said recentlyThe colossal asteroid which named after the Egyptian god of chaos and destruction is expected to approach the Earth dangerously close on April 13 2029 according to the latest data from NASABut there is no need to worry as it will be about 19000 miles 31000 km away from the surface of the EarthNASA said it's relatively rare for such a large object to pass so close to Earth and it will be a great opportunity for asteroid scientists around the world to conduct a closeup study of the Apophis' size shape composition and possibly even its interiorThe Apophis close approach in 2029 will be an incredible opportunity for science Marina Brozovic a radar scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena California said in a NASA releaseWe'll observe the asteroid with both optical and radar telescopes With radar observations we might be able to see surface details that are only a few meters in size Brozovic saidApophis was discovered in 2004 by the US astronomers Since its discovery optical and radar telescopes have tracked Apophis as it continues on its orbit around the Sun so scientists know well its future trajectoryCurrent calculations show that Apophis still has a small chance of impacting Earth NASA said
