When I was visiting in midApril Dandong Liaoning province on the North Korean border I found large juicy strawberries for sale by street pedlars for only 15 yuan 225 for a half kilo That is a real bargainThat was a lot cheaper than the 45 yuan for a half kilo further north in Changchun Jilin province Note the three different bar codes that this cart has for smartphone paymentsWhy the price difference It’s because they are grown locallyWhen I was leaving Dandong I saw this van in front of the train station The owner was selling fresh strawberries to the passengersHow can these strawberries be so cheap yet so big and sweet The bigger question is this How can these strawberries be grown locally and be ready for market so early in the yearAfter all Dandong's weather is very much like Toronto's with very cold winters Strawberries grown in southern Ontario are not ripe until late JuneOn my train trip back to Changchun as I was eating my strawberries I looked out the window and saw the reason that strawberries can be harvested so early They are grown in greenhousesI saw hundreds of greenhouses between Dandong and ShenyangWhen I returned to Toronto I asked Nancy a friend of mine who grew up in this part of Liaoning province if I was rightShe explained that the farmers used to start growing crops in the greenhouses in February just after Chinese New Year and the growing season would end in November But now they grow crops all yearroundSo by using greenhouses the farmers have become far more productiveThis got me thinking Why don't Ontario strawberry farmers build greenhouses and sell us greattasting fresh strawberries in the early springNancy may have had the answer for that tooThe work is very unpleasant as it is very hot and humid in the greenhouses What’s more the pay is lowHolland Marshall lives in Toronto Canada He worked in China for a year and he now visits China once or twice a yearThe opinions expressed here are those of the writer and don't represent the views of China Daily website
