We have just completed a successful Belt and Road Forum that has seen the Belt and Road Initiative BRI which the Belt and Road Forum is centred around reaching a higher level of development On the final day leaders of 37 countries joined Chinese President Xi Jinping in signing a joint communique promising to work together as the BRI enters its next phase This is a considerable step up from the inaugural forum in 2017 where 29 nations made such a pledgeKey takeaways of the joint communique included calling for highquality projects urging investment in connectivity for developed nations and ensuring that cooperation will be open clean and green This signals great intention for a mature and sustainable approach to infrastructure development and a demonstration of how we have progressed to 'BRI 20'Christine Lagarde said in her speech at the Belt and Road Forum where she described the Belt and Road Initiative as a new phase of 'BRI 20' that The BRI is clearly having an impact From stimulating infrastructure investment to developing new global supply chains some of the promises of BRI are being realisedA Broad MarketThe Belt and Road Initiative has a grand vision and will be widely beneficial for the entire worldBy connecting more than 65 countries across Europe Asia and Africa – the BRI will cover 63 per cent of the world's population and 29 per cent of global GDP and ultimately make it easier for goods and services to reach the growing middle classes whose disposable income is increasingThe initiative is doing a great deal for global trade at a time of suppressed growth Over the past six years the total trade volume between China and the other participating countries has surpassed 6 trillion and 82 industrial parks have been established creating nearly 300000 local jobsA great deal of success has been achieved as 126 countries and 29 international organizations have signed more than 170 cooperation agreements of various kinds under the framework of the initiative Over the past six years the total trade volume between China and the other participating countries has surpassed 6 trillion and 82 industrial parks have been established creating nearly 300000 local jobsOther significant results include Chinese enterprises investing over 90 billion in BRI countries between 2013 and 2018 with average annual growth of 52 percent BRI countries invested over 40 billion in China over the same periodBRI for the UAEFor the UAE the Belt and Road Initiative is the centrepiece of our highlyvalued bilateral relationship with China This strategic relationship between our countries and our leaders covers bilateral agreements across many areas including energy business cooperation economic cultural and politicalAttendance at the Belt and Road Forum by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Vice President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and Ruler of Dubai is a reflection of the strong relationship that has developed between the UAE and China The relationship built between the wise leadership of the UAE and President Xi Jinping has progressed greatly since the visit of the Chinese President to the UAE in July of 2018 where a 'Comprehensive Strategic Partnership' was announcedFrom the UAE perspective the Belt and Road Initiative complements our worldview well and our country shares the same beliefs in prosperity and economic sharing in line with Chinese values These values so clearly shine through the Belt and Road InitiativeAn Example of CooperationThe UAEChina relationship and its successes provides a fine example of cooperation between China and countries in the Belt and Road Initiative On the face of it our two countries are quite different in almost every way  from the respective sizes of our countries economy culture you name it However each country approaches each other as an equal and with mutual respect under the umbrella of the Belt and Road Initiative with a businessfocused approachIn much the same regard the Belt and Road Initiative is a great leveller for all who join This programme's focus on infrastructure will improve life in developing nations and boost the global economy I believe that the Belt and Road initiative has proven to be extremely positive already for all countries involvedThere are numerous projects underway all around the world with countless others in the planning and execution stage The total value of projects in the scheme stands at US367 trillion spanning countries in Asia Europe Africa Oceania and South AmericaA Positive ModelThe Belt and Road Initiative offers a positive model for international cooperation based upon a broad principlesbased approach It is an idea and a platform instead of a treatybased organisation There are no restrictive treaties and standards set are reasonable This works well for developing countries by offering a platform that is friendly cooperative and without restrictive terms and conditionsThe BRI has a fresh and flexible approach breathing new life and vitality into the global economy This is underpinned by inclusiveness collectivism and sharing which have bestowed the initiative with great practical significanceThe author is ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to ChinaThe opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the
