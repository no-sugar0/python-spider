At Tianjin's ShangriLa Hotel I watched with fascination a historic daily pageant performed in its expansive lobby Artists dressed in elegant costumes went through classical rituals The troupe was brought north by the tourism bureau of Shandong province's Qufu hometown of renowned philosopher and writer Confucius Visitors to Qufu can experience these reenactments today as Confucian tourism is a major driver of that city's economy I was fixated as they moved gracefully against backdrops displaying insights into that great sage's longstanding legacyIt also provided a chance to reflect on my earlier days of China travel Those journeys across this vast land were always a learning experience At school level back in my native Scotland very little was understood of Confucius or his influence on Chinese thought and culture But I would at times hear things like As Confucius said 'do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you' As a geographer I also became fascinated with the Chinese relationship with land and water and how this influenced building design and construction Confucius wrote The wise delight in water the virtuous delight in mountains The wise are active the virtuous are tranquil The wise are happy the virtuous are longlivedConfucius 551479 BC was a teacher and philosopher from China's Spring and Autumn Period 770476 BC who has had a lasting impact on Chinese culture Today he is recognized internationally for his writings and sayings His philosophy emphasized morality correct social relationships justice and sincerity He championed strong family loyalty respect for ancestors and elders by their children Confucian thought has been influential through much of Chinaâ€™s long history and continues to be held in high esteemQufu is a relatively small city I first came upon in 1996 Then it was an intermediary stop on the railway between Beijing and Shanghai In my early days of travel before today's highspeed services rail travel was much slower But an onboard service now gone were announcements about each station stop In Chinese and in English they would tell of the geography history and distinguished persons associated with each town At Qufu they spoke of Confucius and his legacy As I mentioned I was not so familiar with him expect his name and some wellrecited phrases It was fortuitous to listen and appreciate my proximity to his birthplace
