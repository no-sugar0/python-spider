It was the first time I had visited an ethnic Korean settlement Before leaving Beijing I thought I was fully prepared because I had done a lot of homework to learn about the people's manners and customs and the diet Despite that it was still hard to get used to country lifeHongqi village Antu county Yanbian Korean autonomous prefecture Jilin province enjoys very fresh air and beautiful scenery even in cold weatherMoreover it is only about 100 kilometers from the Changbaishan National Nature Reserve home to Tianchi Lake which is its most famous attractionTo better understand village life I had arranged to lodge at a rural homestay run by Cui Jingyun a pleasant 50something woman She greeted me with a wide smile that helped to allay my anxiety at being alone in a strange placeTake it as your home were the first words she said as she showed me around her house which is a typical Koreanstyle dwelling and fitted with ondol a type of wooden flooring that is heated from belowWe people in Northeast China used to sleep on the ondol I heated up the living room for you yesterday after being informed that a reporter would stay at my houseCurious I touched the ondol which can serve as both a floor and a bed I could tell that Cui was a little nervous but she kept smiling so I wouldn't be embarrassedI've been living alone for a rather long time she said taking bedclothes from a wardrobeMy husband is a native of the village He is an ethnic Korean but I'm not He went to South Korea for work several years ago leaving me here to look after the house because of my poor health and visa problemsI have my two sons in Antu county also lovely grandsons and granddaughters but I still feel lonely in the village Now I have you to keep me companyI felt sorry for her and I was touched by her words I had never expected that my visit could relieve the loneliness of a complete strangerMost of my time in the village was spent interviewing the residents and tourists along with some of the people in charge of village affairs but I always rushed back to the homestay after finishing work to chat with Cui and watch TV with herI have to admit that village life was very different from how I had imagined itThe first problem was the toilet The homestay has modern facilities but a water shortage means they are only available three times a day 5 am to 7 am 11 am to 1 pm and 6 pm to 8 pmCui told me that the mostused toilet for villagers was a pit facility that lacked running waterAt first I was shocked but I soon learned to accept it That's life who knows what may come nextThe first time I visited the pit toilet at night was scary because it was about 50 meters from the house and there were no lightsTake this  it will make you feel much better said Cui passing me a flashlight I took it gladlyThough I encountered some awkward moments during my 10 days in the village especially in terms of hygienic habits or diet I was impressed by the people and their distinctive Korean customs which I may not experience again for some time
