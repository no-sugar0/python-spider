For Zhao Huijiao it's a nightmare in the morning when her roommate stays in the bathroom taking an epic shower But it's even worse if she can't find a driver in her WeChat group carpoolsZhao a 26yearold accountant who lives near the south Sixth Ring Road in Beijing but works in the city's upmarket Guomao area more than 50 kilometers away was a regular user of Didi Chuxing's hitch service It saved her time and moneySince Didi suspended it hitch service in September after the murders of two female passengers by drivers she has joined two WeChat groups that include 500 drivers and users in the neighborhoodsIf the hitch service was still available it would save me a lot trouble finding a driver every day Zhao saidMany people who are active in similar groups also look forward to the resumption of the hitch service And Didi recently began laying the groundwork to restart its carpooling serviceZhang Rui the executive who was brought in to reform the company has proposed five measures to revamp the service restricting drivers' routes abandoning the platform's social features more strictly screening new drivers allocating safety complaints to specialists and improving emergency managementThere is no precise timeline for relaunch yet and the safety of the Didi model still concerns many passengersIf Didi strictly followed those rules the platforms might not survive as some policies are not marketdriven Gao Yu 32 a coder in Beijing said on social media There are still huge potential risks for passengersXu Kangming a transportation expert and policy adviser at the Ministry of Transport said on Weibo that hitch operates on the idea of matching private car owners and passengers heading in a similar direction which is budgetfriendly for both sides and helps address urban congestion and pollution The new business model should be encouragedHowever he added many fulltime drivers flocked to the service as a result of the low threshold for approval of driver applications as well as big profits which went against the essence of carpooling and added uncertainty to passenger safetyThe key is to prevent fulltime hitch drivers by limiting orders to two a day and restricting the routes which might go against the ridehailing platforms' goal of attracting more drivers and passengers Xu saidBut only when the platforms rule out the unqualified hitch drivers will the passenger be truly safe
