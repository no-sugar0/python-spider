Editor's note According to The Guardian a string of small British firms switched to a fourday work week to boost productivity and balance between life and work The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has proposed a fourday 36hour work week for employees in China to be implemented by 2030 Do you support the idea of a fourday work weekhuaqiao ChinaI think France has a fourday work week China must study the case carefully before implementing this One problem with this is that businesses are globalized and linked So if China operates for four days and then switches off for three days in a week businesses will be affected Can this be overcome by shift work How many people do you need to hire for shift work What about salary Will the employees earn enough to enjoy the added leisure time
