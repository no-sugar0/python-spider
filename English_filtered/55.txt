The Belt and Road Initiative BRI should play a major role in supporting innovative startups founded by people from diverse cultural backgroundsThe heart of BRI is mainly based around the infrastructure of countries involved which is laudableMany areas still lack crucial ports bridges and roads and it is critically important that all parts of the world are well equipped to strengthen human progressFrom there others goals may be carried out more effectively such as the protection of the environmentUnlike infrastructure constructed by major corporations or stateowned companies many innovative technologies emerge thanks to young companies staffed by small teamsThe pattern is often the same young professionals gather their forces around a common goal of creating a viable and sustainable company Beyond their determination two conditions are required to fully ensure any project’s successFirst bringing people from diverse cultural backgrounds together isn’t an easy task People need to set aside their differences and be willing to have their thoughts and opinions questioned If they are not willing the new company’s creativity and decisionmaking will be underminedKnowledge and awareness of one another’s histories and cultural sensibilities should awaken people's understanding and tolerance for one anotherUnfortunately this topic is rarely a priority in engineering and management schoolsThe second point deals with financial resources Many startups experience difficulty in attracting capital Financing issues make it harder for teams to concentrate on their core business Many have fallen victim to thisBRI could ease the burden of these problems The initiative should add a new specific aim to support startups – startups that could one day become gigantic firms and overturn the established economic orderActing as a roving incubator BRI must take up the torch Its mission would be to foster innovative startups by reinforcing their human potential and by lending financial support in order to tailor adequate solutions for today’s global challengesThere is a Chinese proverb that says that if three people are of one heart even the yellow earth can become gold We should apply this to BRI and how we support startupsThe views don't necessarily reflect those of China Daily
