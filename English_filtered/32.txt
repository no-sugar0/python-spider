German artist Katharina Grosse says when she was a child she often played a game in her head before getting up in the morning She says she imagined a painting brush with which she would cover all the shadows on the wall the windowsill the lamp and elsewhereYears later Grosse would develop that childhood obsession into an individual approach to painting that is central to her creations But rather than grabbing a brush from her childhood imagination Grosse primarily uses a spray gun to spread vibrant colors directly on the interiors and exteriors of buildings and other objectsGrosse uses a rich scheme of colors which presents an explosive visual effect at first sight and then gives a soothing touch as one looks at her work for a whileShe often embraces the audience in an allimmersive environment  they can walk into her work step on it get lost in it or be absorbed by itAnd her work can engage viewers in a discussion about space and boundariesGrosse is now inviting people in Guangzhou into her colorful world of a maze at a solo exhibition Mumbling Mud at chi K11 art space through June 2The exhibition first came to chi K11 art museum Shanghai And during its threemonth duration which ended Feb 24 visitors commented on social media that they were caught by the dynamics and mystery built by colors as well as a sense of clashes between Grosse's painted works and the environmentStomach a stunning work shown in Shanghai is also installed at the Guangzhou exhibitionFor the work hundreds of meters of fabric on which Grosse orchestras a symphony of colors falls from the ceiling of the art space and covers the floor to form an encircled drapeThe heavy coarse cloth and a labyrinth of folds on it make people entering feel both embraced and lost as they try to find their way out of the drape through several exitsWhen they succeed they are confronted by another work Showroom in which colors are sprayed on a set of furniture and a rank of shelves filled with books and magazines donated by peopleGrosse allows the audience to revise their perceptions of painting sculpture and architecture The exhibition's curator Venus Lau says visitors are likely to experience an overwhelming ungroundedness in Grosse's works
