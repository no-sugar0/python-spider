A United Nations report on Monday said that over 1 million species of plants and animals are in danger of extinction because of human activities which makes species protection one of the hottest topics on domestic social networksYet when many domestic media outlets report it they describe it as a moral obligation for humans Some even claim that extinction of animals threatens the survival of the Earth calling on people to save the Earth and save ourselvesIt is good that they promote species protection but the cause is not what they describe Actually the mass extinction of species has little if anything to do with life on Earth Since life originated on Earth about 35 billion years ago there had been at least five mass extinctions each of which killed more than half of the life on this planetEspecially in the Ordovician extinction which happened about 440 million years ago about 85 percent of the species on Earth were killed possibly by a supernova about 6000 light years awayYet after each of these extinction events life prospered again very soon New species quickly took the places of old ones and flourishedFor the Earth millions of years are like minutes to a human More importantly the Earth does not care which kind of life it hosts For it each of the mass extinctions is just like a round of shuffling cards Whichever life inhabits it it makes little difference to the planetHowever for homo sapiens it is a different story because our hope of surviving a mass extinction is rather low Humans are at the top of food pyramid which means we consume large quantities of food and other resources We are extremely fragile because our existence depends more on other species than they depend on usIf too many species die out it would cause a chain reaction humans might lose the animals and plants that are its food sources and industrial resources as well as materials for other productsSome scientists think that we are already amid the sixth mass extinction the cause of which is human actionsIf so there is another shuffling of life on Earth under way But humans will not be in the new set of cardsTherefore please give up any illusion of being a savior when it comes to the protection of species We humans are saving ourselves that's all
