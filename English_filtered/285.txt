In his speech on Friday to the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation President Xi Jinping emphasized the close links between China's domestic reform its openingup policies and the Belt and Road InitiativeXi laid out five reform and openingup measures Four of them will open China's markets further to international trade and investment These include broadening market access for foreign investment strengthening international cooperation in intellectual property rights protection increasing imports of goods and services on a larger scale and attaching greater importance to the implementation of openingup policiesHis fourth measure stressed the need for more effective international macroeconomic policy coordination Why is this criticalMacroeconomic policy coordination is important even in normal times Ordinarily policymakers who need to alleviate a coming slowdown or recession have two major tools They can use stimulative fiscal policy  tax cuts or increased government spending  to put more funds directly into the hands of consumers and businesses They can also use monetary policy  increases in the availability of loans and cuts in the interest rate  to encourage businesses to invest and consumers to buy large durable goods such as cars homes or appliances Ideally additional spending will lead to more jobs which in turn leads to more spending in a beneficial cycleHowever some portion of that added spending will be used to purchase imports This will drive up the trade deficit of the stimulating country if other countries don't also use stimulative policies This means the stimulus may not achieve its desired domestic effects Naturally a country will be reluctant to implement a policy if much of the benefit goes to foreigners So macroeconomic policy coordination among major trading partners makes antirecessionary measures much more effectiveCoordination is even more critical in times of crisis During the high point of the 2008 financial crisis former US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson worked closely with China and European countries to avoid imminent financial and currency collapse For example US Treasury bonds and bonds issued by US governmentsupported home mortgage lending agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were at risk of significant devaluation or even default during the worst days of the crisis Many investors moved out of these unexpectedly risky assets into cash But the Chinese government supported the crisisfighting efforts of the US government by continuing to hold them If it had not done so the world financial system may well have collapsed In an October 2008 speech Paulson stressed China's useful and constructive help in fighting the turmoilBoth the US and China used extensive monetary and fiscal stimulus to recover from the crisis Europe's recovery was much slower because its nations were not able to coordinate fiscal policy and because the European Central Bank adopted a restrictive monetary policyPresident Xi's call for attaching greater importance to the implementation of openingup policies reinforced a raft of recent policy initiatives to promote further supplyside structural reform of the Chinese economy including very large domestic tax cuts and financial policies designed to support private companiesBy the end of June China will set up an investment policy in which foreign companies will be welcome to invest throughout the economy except in sectors explicitly named on a negative list Sectors being opened up include transportation infrastructure energy education medical care and venture capital among others There will be increased enforcement of intellectual property rightsOpening up to foreign competition by broadening market access to foreign investment strengthening cooperation in intellectual property rights protection and increasing imports of goods and services will benefit foreign companies But more importantly this competition is also a key part of China's longterm development strategyChina is pushing competitiveness in its domestic markets by opening them further to foreign competition  thus forcing Chinese companies to step up independent innovation and industrial upgrading At the Boao Forum in March Premier Li Keqiang explained China will not resort to massive stimulus to boost growth but will continue to open up and innovate to energize market playersThe infrastructure investments of the BRI can enable entrepreneurs immersed in this system to take advantage of opportunities by building businesses or technologies that can't be imagined in advance In many cases in history we've seen economies take off and prosperity spread because trade or transport costs are lowered The latest studies by the World Bank and other international institutions suggest that cooperation has begun to pay off The BRI will cut the costs of global trade by 11 to 22 percent and those of trade along the ChinaCentral AsiaWest Asia Economic Corridor by 102 percentCoordinated fiscal monetary trade and development policies made possible by the BRI are a great opportunity for many countries to implement more effective macroeconomic and development strategies
