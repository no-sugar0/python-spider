Editor's note The accession of Emperor Naruhito to the Chrysanthemum Throne was formally recognized in a ceremony on May 1 which marked the end of the Heisei era and the start of the Reiwa era In a post published on his WeChat account Qin Shuo a financial commentator commentedÂ Perhaps the biggest legacy of Akihito father of the new emperor is that Japan is no longer pursuing economic growthThe scale of the economy is shrinking and the material desires of the people are shrinking The material life of the next generation will be much simpler than the previous generationAt the start of the Heisei era Japan was an innovative country The number of new products it introduced was dizzying At that time every item was envied when it was taken back to ChinaAnd Japanese companies were at the forefront of developments that people did not see such as supercomputers semiconductors photovoltaic cells and car navigation systemsBut after entering the current decade the innovation and development tide of Japanese enterprises suddenly waned No matter whether digital products or new energy and new technologies few of the leading companies in the world are JapaneseAt the start of the Reiwa era it is clear that Japanese industry has lost its enthusiasm for innovationOne of the reasons for this is that the Japanese domestic market has basically halved in the past 30 years completely losing the conditions for revitalizationAfter the automobile industry and other sectors became sluggish in the Japanese market the downturn in the entire market naturally made enterprises afraid to invest in research and developmentThis economic trend of the Heisei era was not reversed by Abenomics and it seems that new economic policies are difficult to come byMany times the biggest problem in Japanese politics is the economy but Japan's political parties seem unable to come up with new economic policies Until they do Japan's economy in the Reiwa era will remain stagnant
