The Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility  which represents a major step in Shanghai's journey to become a worldleading science and technology innovation center  will see its research capability more than double within the next three years the facility's director said on the center's 10year anniversary on MondayZhao Zhentang the director said there will be 40 beam lines and 60 laboratories in operation at the facility by 2022 up from the current 15 beam lines and 19 laboratories Over the past decade its area has doubled to 107100 square meters he saidThe facility the first large science project jointly invested by the central government and the municipal government of Shanghai in involved in frontier scientific research in various fields including life sciences new materials physics chemistry environmental sciences and archaeology It is by far the largest scientific project in ChinaWhile there were only 300 users when the facility opened in 2009 the number has surged to more than 24600 There are nearly 100 overseas users now mainly from the Republic of Korea Japan Australia and Canada The facility operates 7000 hours a yearShi Erwei a senior researcher at the Shanghai Zhangjiang Comprehensive National Science Center said a large number of Nobel laureates in physics over the past few decades have made breakthroughs at large scientific installationsIn 2013 China Petroleum and Chemical Corp announced a 380 million yuan 56 million investment to build three beam lines at the facilityShi said this signals that China's scientific research has entered a new age in which the government teams up with companies to coinvest in large scientific projects while in the past the government had to shoulder all the responsibilityHe added that such large scientific projects would not be able to stand without the support of the country's manufacturing industryBut the stable ongoing operation of large scientific projects is much more important than simply building them It is only when they can run in the manner of public utilities such as subways that they can be defined as complete highend scientific projects he saidXu Hongjie a senior researcher at the Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics participated in writing the design report for the radiation facility a decade ago He said it was a great delight to see it operating in line with industrial standards throughout the year as some other similar facilities in China only operate for short periodsThe radiation facility is one major part of a cluster of largescale radiation scientific projects in Zhangjiang where one of the country's three comprehensive national science centers is based Seven other major projects such as beam line stations hard Xray freeelectron laser equipment and soft Xray freeelectron laser equipment form a cluster with a total investment of around 138 billion yuan 712 percent of which will come from the municipal government of Shanghai All eight projects will be completed and operational by 2025
