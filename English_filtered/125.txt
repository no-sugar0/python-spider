Reiwa or beautiful harmony as Naruhito received the imperial regalia and sealsIn an address to the people Naruhito pledged to follow his father's example in devoting himself to peace and sharing the joys and sorrows of the people while showing compassionI will reflect deeply on the path taken by past emperors and abide by the Constitution to fulfill my responsibility as a national symbol he said adding that he will always turn his thoughts to the people and stand with themYesterday was the last day of the era called Heisei or achieving peace Japanese people cried prayed traveled and shopped on their unprecedented 10day holidayOn Tuesday 85yearold Akihito relinquished his title making him the first Japanese monarch in 200 years to step downAs the country's first emperor living under the postwar Constitution Akihito is widely revered for healing the wounds brought by Japan in the World War II and bringing the imperial family closer to the peopleMany Japanese would say Akihito Naruhito's father did maintain peace during his 30yearreign as his era name aspired to His final message to his people reiterated that theme At this moment I just pray for peace and happiness for our country and the world However there are people worrying that the emperor's pacifist efforts had been offset by Japanese government's reflection on the war and seeking military expansionI'm really moved and can't stop crying when the emperor said his last hope for the country is to pray for peace and happiness said Nobuichi Takahashi who had tried to keep his wartime memories locked away for many decadesIn the final days of World War II Takahashi now 86 lost his father and watched his cousin burned alive by incendiary bombs and can't forget how he had struggled to flee over people's dead bodiesWorking as a lecturer for an antiwar civil organization Takahashi hopes that he can convey the cruelty and horrors of war to young Japanese who don't have a clue on what a war isChildren today don't know enough about the war the education they received was censored and minimized the Imperial Army's actions If they don't understand how cruel a war can be and how people suffered from it they may follow a mistaken path again Takahashi told China Daily after giving a speech at Kanagawa Residents' Center in YokohamaIn the name of Akihito's father Hirohito Japanese troops fought the war bringing huge losses to countries including the United States China and many other Asian neighbors In contrast preventing Japan from forgetting the war has been a consistent priority of AkihitoHe traveled to China Indonesia Malaysia the Philippines and Vietnam all the places that had suffered from Japan's invasion At every stop Akihito paid tribute to the war victims spoke of peace and promised his nation would never repeat the horrors of warTakahashi said he admired Akihito's efforts as it rehabilitated Japan's reputation abroad but he also worried what the emperor did had been largely offset by some Japanese conservative politicians who derided Akihito's apology tour arguing that Japan had apologized enoughI think people can know they were really sorry for what Japan's imperial army had done when the emperor and empress bowing for the war victims Takahashi said His words of not repeating war is in line with his sincerity when he apologized and that's why he was respected by the worldHowever some politicians didn't appreciate it the same way Takahashi saidThe mission of Japan's SelfDefense Force significantly expanded during the Heisei Era From its first overseas operation to the Persian Gulf in 1991 SDF are allowed to fight in foreign conflicts in 2015 and started to take part in missions outside the United Nations this AprilMany say the expansion will continue until Japan is a normal country Takahashi said if it were true that will be too sad because it means all the efforts by Emperor Akihito had been undoneFor Kotai Odajima Heisei was a time of shocking disasters and economic stagnation Odajima said he loves and respects Emperor Akihito a lot because he always reached out to the people when the country suffered disastersMany disasters occurred during Heisei such as the Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995 the sarin gas accident in Tokyo in the same year and the massive earthquake and tsunami in northeast Japan in 2011 Odajima saidThe Emperor always showed up during hard times kindly reached out to the people It makes me feel he is very close to us
