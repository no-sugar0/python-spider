US President Donald Trump's recent tariff threats were both surprising and to be expectedSurprising as his claim that the reason for the tariff hikes was negotiations between the two countries were regressing differs starkly from the US administration's previous remarks that good progress was being made in the trade talksTo be expected as it is not the first time that the United States has sought to turn the screws on China in an attempt to hustle an advantage in the negotiationsDespite Trump's tweets on Sunday threatening to raise the tariffs on 200 billion of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent and target a further 325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs shortly — essentially covering all Chinese products imported by the US — VicePremier Liu He is to attend the 11th round of trade and economic consultations between the two countries in Washington on Thursday and Friday as plannedThis is consistent with China's commitment to actively work with the US to resolve their differences and end the dispute and it hopes the US negotiators will work hard with its representatives so the two sides can meet each other half wayWhile it is not clear whether Trump's threat of tariff hikes is intended to raise the stakes so China makes some lastminute concessions or a prelude to real action the US administration should bear in mind that a fullblown trade war will not harm China alone it will also damage the US economyIf the US raises tariffs on Chinese goods as Trump has threatened it will of course have an impact on the Chinese economy to some extent However given the durability it has demonstrated not as much perhaps as Washington anticipates Nor should Washington expect the US economy will remain unscathed as it seems to believe The US will undoubtedly receive some damaging blows in return — both directly through China's retaliatory measures and indirectly through the impacts any escalation in their trade frictions will have on the global economyWith the world economy already showing signs of a slowdown and major international organizations warning that the uncertainties caused by the ongoing trade tensions are creating headwinds for global growth and disrupting global supply chains the proposed tariff hikes would be selfharming at a time when there has been growing anticipation that a deal can be struck — with some reports suggesting that preparations were underway for a meeting between the leaders of the two countries so they could sign off on a dealCertainly the previous 10 rounds of talks have produced consensuses on some important issues that promised a resolution to the frictions and there were comments from both sides suggesting an agreement was close to being reachedThe two sides should therefore continue to make efforts to reach a settlement — on the basis of mutual respectThe art of a deal is in finalizing it not blowing it up
