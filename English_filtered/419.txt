Among the five senior citizens who appear in the first episode only 68yearold Tan Shaozhu used to work in restaurants Sun Lijun 63 is a former gynecologist Li Junhu 69 was a plumber Hu Gongying 76 was a teacher and 80yearold Li Dongqiao is a retired military officerSometimes it's like working with five children Huang says But their life experiences sense of responsibility persistence and positive outlooks are always present which I find deeply touchingMany funny moments arise in the pilot episode of the showFor example during rehearsals a participant forgets to ask the customer played by Huang to pay the bill Consequently once the restaurant opens he keeps staring back at the table he serves in case someone dines and dashes leaving without paying the bill His unflappable attention confuses many customersAnother participant accuses the chef of making the wrong dish until she realizes she had simply forgotten which dish the customer had orderedOther moments are capable of reducing the audience to tears When one elderly waitress tries to explain to customers that she is a patient she even forgets the name of her disease
