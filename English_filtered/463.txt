Innovation in technology that underpins cryptocurrencies seen as serving real economyIndustries are stepping up efforts in blockchain technology to serve the real economy even though the global cryptocurrency market could be facing tough timesAs of November China led the world in new blockchain projects with 263 in progressThe figure accounted for about 25 percent of such projects globally according to data service provider Blockdata in BeijingBlockchain refers to the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies but its real value goes far beyond that In the digital ledger system transactions are recorded chronologically and publicly ensuring that data is secure and not tampered with while allowing it to be shared among a distributed network of computers without the involvement of middlemenThe technology is used widely across a range of industries in China like financial services public services healthcare supply chains smart manufacturing and logisticsThe main strength of blockchain is in decentralized data management said Zhang Feixue chief editor at Blockdata It can serve the real economy in terms of circulation and distribution In the field of industrial economy blockchain allows various assets to flow in the digital world so it is a real gateway to digitalization for industriesPaul Sin leader of the Asia Pacific Blockchain Lab at global advisory company Deloitte said Whenever there is a need to synchronize data especially sensitive information across companies industries and geographical boundaries blockchain can offer a great solution due to its cryptographical protection of dataFor instance trade finance will allow banks to detect fraud improve productivity and eventually enable small and mediumsized enterprises to obtain financing that was once unavailable to them This is a solid example of blockchain supporting financial inclusion and macroeconomic growth Sin saidIn Deloitte's 2018 global blockchain survey nearly 50 percent of respondents in China said the technology was already being used in their organization compared with only 14 percent in the United StatesLi Qilei chief technology officer at Qulian Technology a blockchain platform developer in China said the financial industry is now the biggest user of the technology in areas such as asset securitization for banks and brokersTake Qulian for example On an accounts receivable platform it developed with China Zheshang Bank the scale of financing has reached hundreds of billions of yuan since its launch in August 2017Qulian in Hangzhou capital of Zhejiang province launched Hyperchain which focuses on enterpriselevel network solutions for companies government agencies and industry alliancesIn June the company said it had raised a series B round of financing of 15 billion yuan 222 million  the largest amount in the domestic blockchain industry at the timeIn addition to linking with financial services Li said blockchain can be applied in other areas such as green energy and smart government Qulian is also working with some housing bureaus to build a trusted property chain with the aim of preventing fake housing information appearing onlineQulian is just one of 615 blockchain companies in China with 82 percent of them founded between 2016 and last year according to a report in December by Beijing think tank EO Intelligence Half of the companies are working on the adoption of blockchain technology in the financial industryInternet giants Baidu Alibaba and Tencent  collectively known as BAT in the industry  have launched their own blockchain initiativesAlibaba has been using blockchain in areas such as public welfare food and healthcare since 2016 With 90 blockchainrelated patents it ranked No 1 in the Top 100 Blockchain Enterprise Patent Rankings followed by international technology giant IBM's 89 patents according to Beijing intellectual property information media outlet IPRdaily which compiled the list last year Tencent ranked eighth with 40 patents while Baidu was 40th with fewer than 20In August the tax bureau in Shenzhen Guangdong province and Tencent announced that China's first blockchain electronic invoice had been issuedDu Xiaoman Financial formerly known as Baidu Finance released its blockchain white paper to outline its capability in developing applications in eight areas  consumer finance management of financial clients and community building asset digitalization public welfare identity systems digital content copyright interconnection between different products and trackingChina's innovations are also expanding overseas one example being Ant Financial Alibaba's financial services affiliate which operates mobile payment tool AlipayInternational blockchain companies are also looking to China for opportunities Digital Asset in New York is one example The distributed ledger technology provider is working with Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing to develop a blockchainpowered program to help international investors to trade Chinese mainland shares via Hong Kong's Stock Connect systemChris Church chief business development officer for Digital Asset said One of the reasons that HKEX is so important to us is because it is a gateway to the mainland's stock market He added that he feels excited about how people want to advance the technology in the regionKang Li assistant director at the Blockchain Research Center of China at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu Sichuan province said a blockchain product has yet to be put into practice on a large scale in ChinaThe industry is still in a blossoming phase where more and more companies can come up with all kinds of chains but they don't have an explicit idea of application service or supporting content Kang saidAlthough many see the potential in blockchain applications the attitude being adopted is still relatively prudent due to a lack of direct return In addition regulations user acceptance and conflicts with other industries are all issues facing the blockchain industryData from research and advisory company Gartner show that in 2017 82 percent of reported cases of blockchain use were in financial services while the figure fell to 46 percent last year The data appeared in the PwC Global Blockchain Survey 2018In December Pan Gongsheng deputy governor of the People's Bank of China the central bank said initial coin and security token offerings are essentially illegal in China no matter how fancy the technical terms are He said internet finance and related tools should be under even stricter supervisionSince Feb 15 the Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission at the Cyberspace Administration of China has been implementing Regulations on the Management of Blockchain Information Services under which providers must file their information on the listing system within 10 days of launching the serviceQulian's Li said that blockchain as a distributed ledger technology provides a very good tool for the supervision of finance and related sectors adding that blockchain can be used to counter fake documents or to provide realtime tracking of wealth management productsLi added that Qulian is working with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to draft industry standards Although some reports have said a national blockchain standard will be established this year Li does not expect it to happen so soon especially as the industry needs more freedom to developSin from Deloitte said that to help adopt permitted technology the government needs to understand blockchain and see how it works under existing regulationsKong Hui senior data analyst with Blockdata said To some extent regulations act as a kind of support to the industry When the industry is unregulated some companies can make money easily but it will be insecure for all industry players But if they know where the bottom line is it will be clearer for companies to know where they can head toBlockchain is not a magic fix for all industries If it is just used to build an immutable database for higher transparency then the rate of return should be questioned Kong saidLi said there are some deficiencies in blockchain technology in terms of how it can be expanded privacy exchange and protection as well as antiattack capabilitySin said We are starting to realize that some cases of use will be better supported with other technologies such as Open API  rationalizing such cases is a healthy sign Open API is a publicly available applicationprogramming interface that allows third parties to share a proprietary software application or web serviceBlockchain spending worldwide is expected to reach 117 billion by 2022 according to a report by global consultancy International Data Corp Respondents to PwC's survey believe that in three to five years China will lead the global trend in developing blockchainCurrently we don't see a huge difference between blockchain development in China and the US in terms of the businesstobusiness market Li saidHe added that once the technology is mature enough to unlock the consumer market blockchain development in China will be much faster than in the US thanks to the country's fastgrowing internet industry and large user baseIn 2017 many observers expected blockchain to bring disruptive change to the world But the industry was soon hit by the cryptocurrency collapse The value of bitcoin one of the world's most popular virtual currencies plunged by more than 80 percent last year from its record high of nearly 20000 per bitcoin in December 2017When all the noise hype and speculation dies down we expect an increasing focus on the real application of the technology in solving real business problems to create solid synergetic values Sin saidKang from the Blockchain Research Center of China said the easing of cryptocurrency investment will be conducive for the healthy development of blockchain This will allow capital to flow to applications that generate real value and services he addedIn the initial stage there could be some products that do not fully accord with the characteristics of blockchain but developing blockchain applications needs to be done step by step Kang said adding that 2019 will be a year for such applicationsKong from Blockdata said it is still too early to talk about how disruptive blockchain can be It is still at a nascent stage and will only be upgraded to blockchain 20 if it really finds its roots in serving the real economy she said
