People are putting nature in more trouble now than at any other time in human history with extinction looming over 1 million species of plants and animals scientists said MondayBut it's not too late to fix the problem according to the United Nations' first comprehensive report on biodiversityWe have reconfigured dramatically life on the planet report cochairman Eduardo Brondizio of Indiana University said at a press conferenceSpecies loss is accelerating to a rate tens or hundreds of times faster than in the past the report said More than half a million species on land have insufficient habitat for longterm survival and are likely to go extinct many within decades unless their habitats are restored The oceans are not any better offHumanity unwittingly is attempting to throttle the living planet and humanity's own future said George Mason University biologist Thomas Lovejoy who has been called the godfather of biodiversity for his research He was not part of the reportThe biological diversity of this planet has been really hammered and this is really our last chance to address all of that Lovejoy saidConservation scientists convened in Paris to issue the report which exceeded 1000 pages The Intergovernmental SciencePolicy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services IPBES included more than 450 researchers who used 15000 scientific and government reports The report's summary had to be approved by representatives of all 109 nationsSome nations hit harder by the losses like small island countries wanted more in the report Others such as the United States were cautious in the language they sought but they agreed we're in trouble said Rebecca Shaw chief scientist for the World Wildlife Fund who observed the final negotiationsThis is the strongest call we've seen for reversing the trends on the loss of nature Shaw saidThe findings are not just about saving plants and animals but about preserving a world that's becoming harder for humans to live in said Robert Watson a former top NASA and British scientist who headed the reportWe are indeed threatening the potential food security water security human health and social fabric of humanity Watson told The Associated PressIt's also an economic and security issue as countries fight over scarcer resources Watson said the poor in less developed countries bear the greatest burdenThe report's 39page summary highlighted five ways people are reducing biodiversity— Turning forests grasslands and other areas into farms cities and other developments The habitat loss leaves plants and animals homeless About threequarters of Earth's land twothirds of its oceans and 85 percent of crucial wetlands have been severely altered or lost making it harder for species to survive the report said— Overfishing the world's oceans A third of the world's fish stocks are overfished— Permitting climate change from the burning of fossil fuels to make it too hot wet or dry for some species to survive Almost half of the world's land mammals — not including bats — and nearly a quarter of the birds have already had their habitats hit hard by global warming— Polluting land and water Every year 300 to 400 million tons of heavy metals solvents and toxic sludge are dumped into the world's waters— Allowing invasive species to crowd out native plants and animals The number of invasive alien species per country has risen 70 percent since 1970 with one species of bacteria threatening nearly 400 amphibian speciesThe key to remember is it's not a terminal diagnosis said report coauthor Andrew Purvis of the Natural History Museum in LondonFighting climate change and saving species are equally important the report said and working on both environmental problems should go hand in hand Both problems exacerbate each other because a warmer world means fewer species and a less biodiverse world means fewer trees and plants to remove heattrapping carbon dioxide from the air Lovejoy saidThe world's coral reefs are a perfect example of where climate change and species loss intersect If the world warms another 05 C which other reports say is likely coral reefs will probably dwindle by 70 percent to 90 percent the report said At 1 C the report said 99 percent of the world's coral will be in troubleBusiness as usual is a disaster Watson saidAt least 680 species with backbones have already gone extinct since 1600 The report said 559 domesticated breeds of mammals used for food have disappeared More than 40 percent of the world's amphibian species more than onethird of the marine mammals and nearly onethird of sharks and fish are threatened with extinctionThe report relies heavily on research by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature or IUCN which is composed of biologists who maintain a list of threatened speciesThe IUCN calculated in March that 27159 species are threatened endangered or extinct in the wild out of nearly 100000 species biologists examined in depth That includes 1223 mammal species 1492 bird species and 2341 fish species Nearly half the threatened species are plantsScientists have only examined a small fraction of the estimated 8 million species on EarthThe report comes up with 1 million species in trouble by extrapolating the IUCN's 25 percent threatened rate to the rest of the world's species and using a lower rate for the estimated 55 million species of insects Watson saidOutside scientists such as Lovejoy and others said that's a reasonable assessmentThe report gives only a generic within decades time frame for species loss because it is dependent on many variables including taking the problem seriously which can reduce the severity of the projections Watson saidWe're in the middle of the sixth great extinction crisis but it's happening in slow motion said Conservation International and University of California Santa Barbara ecologist Lee Hannah who was not part of the reportFive times in the past Earth has undergone mass extinctions where much of life on Earth blinked out like the one that killed the dinosaurs Watson said the report was careful not to call what's going on now as a sixth big dieoff because current levels don't come close to the 75 percent level in past mass extinctionsThe report goes beyond species Of the 18 measured ways nature helps humans the report said 14 are declining with food and energy production noticeable exceptions The report found downward trends in nature's ability to provide clean air and water good soil and other essentialsHabitat loss is one of the biggest threats and it's happening worldwide Watson said The report projects 25 million kilometers of new roads will be paved over nature between now and 2050 most in the developing worldMany of the worst effects can be prevented by changing the way we grow food produce energy deal with climate change and dispose of waste the report said That involves concerted action by governments companies and peopleIndividuals can help with simple changes to the way they eat and use energy said the cochairman of the report ecological scientist Josef Settele of the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research in Germany That doesn't mean becoming a vegetarian or vegan but balancing meat vegetables and fruit and walking and biking more Watson saidWe can actually feed all the coming billions of people without destroying another inch of nature Lovejoy said Much of that can be done by eliminating food waste and being more efficient he saidAP
