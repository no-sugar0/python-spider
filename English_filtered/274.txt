How do you make traditional cultural heritage come alive and have relevance in today's world How did Mei Lanfang influence the European theater Today we learn about these topics and more in a conversation with Stathis Livathinos artistic director of the National Theater of Greece a man who always stands at the forefront of the global stageIn February his bilingual play Agamemnon will open to audiences in Beijing The work an extraordinary experiment from the national theaters of China and Greece will represent the merging of two great theatrical traditionsLivathinos who has visited China three times describes each of his journeys to the country with great affection My first travel to China was 12 years ago I think on my way to Xi'an to see the Terracotta Army and Beijing which was like a fairy tale for me very unique he said Then I went to Tibet which was a journey I will never forget in my lifeLast year the first collaborative project between the two national theaters – The Orphan of Zhao by Chinese director Wang Xiaoying – became a big success in Athens I was thrilled by Zhao It was a great work a very interesting epic play and a very difficult one said LivathinosFollowing Zhao the Greek director agreed to bring a Greek play to China The upcoming production Agamemnon by ancient Greek tragedian Aeschylus often described as the father of tragedy is the first part of his only extant trilogy Livathinos chose this particular work to present something both Greek and internationalAgamemnon is a part of something bigger that doesn't belong only to Greece Agamemnon is a part I think of the world civilization It's the same as Bach like Shakespeare like Pinter like Beckett like Da Vinci These are the reasons we exist These are the reasons that keep us humanUsing a mostly Chinese cast to tell a millenniaold tale from the European continent in front of a Chinese audience is more than just daring And Livathinos is determined to create a distinctive playBecause it's part of an experiment we agreed on two years ago with the director of the National Theater of China It will be a kind of theatrical and artistic meeting of civilizations onstage Of course this will be a very big risk But it's better to go with a risk than with safetyThanks to his theatrical education in Moscow Livathinos is very familiar with the influence Chinese performing artists have had on theater in the West Chinese theater and many actors especially Mei Lanfang at the beginning of the 20th century influenced the European theater very much especially Meyerhold And his relation to Meyerhold gave many important results in the world of the Russian classics and through them as a big river to the theater of the whole of EuropeThough he points out the language barrier during cultural exchanges particularly in theatrical arts what always matters most is the efforts people make As a Chinese proverb goes 'a big journey starts from one step' It will take generations for real understanding to happen But this is a good step and for me a very unique experienceIf you goFeb 2024 Feb 26March 2 Theater National Theater of China 277 Guang'anmen Outer Street Xicheng district 01083069696 北京市西城区广安门外大街277号 国家话剧院For more details go to ntcccomcnContact the producer at liwenruichinadailycomcn
